# Churn-prediction
In this project, number of popular machine learning methods were utilized for customer churn prediction.
According to the results of this project, XG-Boost and LightGBM outperformed other models.
The XG-Boost model is more accurate, faster, and more efficient than the decision tree model and works more orderly, thus eliminating the over-fitting problem. 
The LightGBM model was introduced by Ke et al. in 2017 and works based on two new methods. One is “gradient-based one-side sampling”, which enables the model to balance between reducing data samples and maintaining the accuracy of the decision tree model. The second new method is Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB), which effectively reduces the data properties and ultimately increases the training speed of the model. Using these two methods, The LightGBM model benefits from these two methods in higher accuracy and training speed and lower memory usage than other models. Using large-scale data is another advantage of the model.
feature importance analysis is a great technique  to find the best set of features. You can use SHAP or one of the machine learning models to find the most and least important features.
